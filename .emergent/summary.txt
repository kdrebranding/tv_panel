The previous AI engineer successfully initiated a full-stack application development process. Initially, the environment was a FastAPI backend with React frontend and MongoDB. The user's initial request for a PHP license system caused confusion due to the existing Python/JavaScript stack. After clarification, the project pivoted to building a TV Panel system, porting functionalities from a PHP repository () to the existing FastAPI/React stack.

The AI engineer developed the core TV Panel, including client and license management, panel/app configuration, and an admin interface. Subsequently, advanced features like Telegram bot integration, advanced reports, backup/restore, and a mobile API were requested and partially implemented. The most significant recent pivot involved migrating the entire database from MongoDB to SQL (specifically, setting up for MySQL/PostgreSQL but using SQLite for development). This transition involved rewriting backend data models and API endpoints, and implementing a JSON importer for initial data population. The work concluded with the frontend being updated to support editing functionalities for the new SQL data, and the next step involves updating the CSS and ensuring the SQL server is fully operational and integrated.

The project's evolution started with an existing FastAPI (Python) backend and React (JavaScript) frontend, utilizing MongoDB. The primary goal shifted from a generic PHP license system to a TV Panel application, requiring the porting or re-implementation of features from a PHP codebase found at .

The core functionalities required for the TV Panel included:
1.  **IPTV Client Management**: Listing, adding, editing, and deleting clients with expiration dates, and import/export capabilities.
2.  **License System**: Management of license keys, subscription expiration, MAC addresses, and active/expired statuses.
3.  **Panel and Application Management**: Configuration for various IPTV panels (e.g., Smart IPTV, TiviMate) and associated applications.
4.  **Notification System**: Initially basic, later specified as Telegram bot integration for reminders and messages.
5.  **Admin Panel**: Login system, system settings, and password generator.

Following the initial build, the user requested additional advanced features:
*   **Telegram bot integration** for notifications.
*   **Advanced reports and analytics**.
*   **Backup and restore** data functionality.
*   **API for mobile applications**.

Most recently, the user explicitly requested a migration from the MongoDB database to an **SQL database (MySQL/PostgreSQL preference)**, along with the ability to import data from provided JSON files and implement **editing capabilities** for all data.

<code_architecture>
The application is structured as a full-stack project with distinct frontend and backend directories, managed by Supervisor for background execution.

**Directory Structure:**


-   : This is the main FastAPI application file. It was initially configured for MongoDB and has been heavily modified to integrate new SQL-based routers (, , ) and services like the Telegram bot. It handles application-wide concerns like CORS.
-   : The primary React component responsible for the entire user interface. It has undergone multiple rewrites to implement the TV Panel dashboard, client management, and UI for advanced features. Most recently, it was updated to support data editing in line with the SQL migration and JSON import.
-   : Specifies Python dependencies. It was updated to include  (for initial MongoDB), then ,  (for MySQL, or other drivers for PostgreSQL), , , , and  for advanced features and SQL migration.
-   : A utility script for populating the database. Initially set up for MongoDB, it was modified to handle date serialization. Crucially, it was then rewritten to initialize the SQL database and import data based on the provided JSON files and SQL schema.
-   : Manages all long-running processes (backend, frontend). It was updated to include the  script as a new supervised program.
-   : **New file.** Created during the SQL migration, this file establishes the SQLAlchemy engine and session, defining the connection to the SQL database (currently configured for SQLite for development, but ready for MySQL/PostgreSQL). This file is critical for abstracting database interactions.
-   : **New file.** This file contains the FastAPI router with API endpoints that perform CRUD operations against the SQL database using SQLAlchemy models. It effectively replaces the MongoDB-specific data access logic.
-   : **New file.** This script facilitates the one-time or on-demand import of data from the provided JSON files into the newly structured SQL database, ensuring data continuity during the migration.
-   : Defines the overall styling for the application. It was updated to support the new UI elements introduced for the TV Panel features and the recent data editing capabilities.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the CSS updates in  to fully support the new editing functionalities.
-   Ensure full integration and functionality of the new SQL-based backend (, ) with the frontend.
-   Confirm that all imported JSON data is correctly displayed and editable through the UI.
-   Verify that all advanced features (Telegram bot, reports, backup/restore, mobile API) are fully functional with the new SQL backend.
-   Transition the SQL database connection from SQLite (development) to MySQL/PostgreSQL (production).

<current_work>
The AI engineer has successfully built the TV Panel application. Initially, it was a FastAPI backend with React frontend and MongoDB. The application provides core features like IPTV Client Management (listing, adding, editing clients with expiration dates), a basic License System (keys, MAC addresses, statuses), Panel and Application Management, and an Admin Panel.

Following the initial setup, the user requested several advanced features. The AI engineer has initiated the implementation of these:
1.  **Telegram Bot Integration**: A new file  was created.
2.  **Advanced Reports & Analysis**: A new module  was introduced.
3.  **Backup & Restore**: A dedicated script  was added.
4.  **Mobile API**: A new module  was created.
These new modules have been integrated into the main .

The most recent and significant undertaking is the migration of the database from MongoDB to SQL. The user provided an SQL schema and 8 JSON files containing existing data. The AI engineer has:
*   Updated  to include necessary SQL dependencies (, ).
*   Created  to handle the SQL connection and ORM setup (currently using SQLite for development purposes).
*   Created  to define the new API endpoints interacting with the SQL database.
*   Developed  to import the provided JSON data into the SQL database, successfully populating the database with initial data.
*   Updated  to adapt the frontend to the new SQL data structure and to introduce data editing capabilities.
*   Updated  to add styling for these new functionalities.

At the moment, the system has successfully imported data into the SQL (SQLite) database, and the frontend  has been updated to support editing. The immediate next step is to complete the CSS styling for these new editing features and ensure the SQL server's full operational integration.
