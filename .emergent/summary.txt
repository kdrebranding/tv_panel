The AI engineer successfully migrated a FastAPI/React/MongoDB application to an SQL backend (SQLite for dev, MySQL for prod), addressing numerous UI bugs and implementing new features like manual password input, Smart TV Activation, and an App Code for Android applications. A major phase involved fixing broken UI elements post-migration, followed by deep integration with a Telegram bot. The engineer meticulously fixed issues related to data display (mocked vs. real data), client list rendering, and adding CSV import functionality. The most recent interactions focused on providing the user with deployment packages for an aaPanel VPS, troubleshooting missing files during user-initiated manual setup, and providing step-by-step instructions for a manual installation, including correcting a critical  file and environment configuration.

<product_requirements>
The project aimed to transform an MVP FastAPI/React/MongoDB TV Panel into a robust application, migrating features from a PHP codebase. Core functionalities required include IPTV Client Management (CRUD, import/export), License System, Panel/Application Management, and Admin features (login, settings, password generator). Advanced features like Telegram bot integration for notifications, advanced reports, backup/restore, and a mobile API were also requested. A critical requirement was the full migration from MongoDB to SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL), coupled with JSON data import and comprehensive UI editing. Post-migration, user requests included: manual password input for new clients, a Smart TV Activation section with auto-generated IDs, app name/price, and currency selection. The IPTV Applications section was renamed Android Applications and required an app code field for bot integration. The engineer was provided with the bot's code for panel adaptation, and the latest focus has been on ensuring complete functionality, accurate data display, and providing a deployable package for a VPS environment.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-Stack Development**: React (frontend) and FastAPI (backend).
-   **Database Technologies**: Transitioned from MongoDB (Motor) to SQL (SQLAlchemy for SQLite development, aiming for MySQL/PostgreSQL).
-   **State Management**: Redux Toolkit for React.
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS.
-   **Process Management**: Supervisor for background services.
-   **API Design**: RESTful APIs with  prefix.
-   **Authentication**: JWT for secure API interactions.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is structured as a full-stack project with distinct frontend and backend directories, managed by Supervisor.

**Directory Structure:**


-   : Main FastAPI application file (older version, pre-SQL migration).
-   : The core React component. Heavily modified to support SQL data, editing, new sections (Smart TV Activation, Telegram Bot management), manual password input, Android App fields, CSV import functionality, and clickable dashboard stats cards with filtering. A major rewrite was performed to fix syntax errors and integrate new components like .
-   : Python dependencies. Updated to include , , , , , , and  for SQL and bot integration.
-   : Manages processes. Configured to run  and .
-   : Defines SQLAlchemy engine and ORM models. Initially set for SQLite, later modified to connect to MySQL (then reverted to SQLite for development due to user's MySQL access issues).  model and  field for  model were added.
-   : Contains FastAPI routers for SQL CRUD operations. Updated for , new  model fields, fixed JWT import, added  endpoint for real-time bot metrics, and  for CSV client import. This file was recently re-provided to the user as they were missing it.
-   : Script for importing JSON data into the SQL database.
-   : Styling. Updated for new UI elements, improved dropdowns, responsive tables, interactive settings, and  styling.
-   : Telegram bot integration. Its database connection was identified as using MongoDB, necessitating backend and frontend changes to work with the SQL database.
-   , , , , , , , : Various deployment-related documentation and scripts generated for generic VPS and specific aaPanel environments.
-   : MySQL database schema with example data, generated for production deployment.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Ensure full functionality of advanced features (reports, backup/restore, mobile API) with the SQL backend. (While Telegram bot integration progress has been made, comprehensive testing across all advanced features is still pending).
-   Troubleshoot and complete the aaPanel VPS deployment with the user, ensuring all files are correctly placed and the application runs.

<current_work>
The TV Panel application has undergone a significant transformation, successfully migrating from MongoDB to a SQL database (SQLite for development, with MySQL credentials and schema prepared for production). All initial JSON data has been imported, and the frontend is adapted for comprehensive editing.

Recent work has focused on:
1.  **UI/UX Improvements and Bug Fixes**: Missing Add new buttons, poor dropdown visibility, table overflow, and unresponsive System Settings were identified and resolved. The JSON data management sections were also refactored to work with SQL, with clickable data cards navigating to relevant filtered views.
2.  **New Feature Implementation**:
    *   **Smart TV Activation**: A new section with a dedicated model, CRUD endpoints, and frontend integration.
    *   **Manual Password Input**: Modified client creation form to allow manual password input.
    *   **Android Applications Renaming**: IPTV Applications was renamed, and  and  fields were added to the  model.
    *   **Telegram Bot Integration**: The bot's  was analyzed. Backend () now includes a  endpoint to provide real-time bot statistics from the SQL database (instead of mocked data). The frontend () includes a dedicated  component that fetches and displays these real stats.
    *   **CSV Import**: An endpoint () and a frontend component were added to allow importing client data from CSV files.
    *   **Dashboard Clickable Stats**: Dashboard cards (Total Clients, Active, Expiring Soon, Expired) are now clickable, navigating to filtered client lists.
    *   **Days to Expiry Column**: A Za ile dni wygasa (Days to Expiry) column with dynamic color-coding was added to the client lists in the frontend for quick status assessment.

The immediate work before this summary was assisting the user with VPS deployment to aaPanel. The engineer provided a ZIP package, deployment guides, and an automatic installation script (). However, the user encountered issues with missing files after manual extraction ( not found,  missing), indicating incomplete transfer or extraction from GitHub. The AI engineer is now providing manual steps to re-create critical missing files and set up the environment, including rewriting the  file to address the missing components on the user's end.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to continue guiding the user through the manual installation on their aaPanel VPS, ensuring all critical files are present and correctly configured. This involves verifying the  directory contents and then guiding them to set up the Python backend environment and  file for database connection.
