The AI engineer successfully transformed a nascent FastAPI/React/MongoDB application into a functional TV Panel system, migrating core features from a PHP legacy. A significant pivot involved a complete database migration from MongoDB to SQL (SQLite for development), requiring extensive backend model rewrites and frontend adaptations for editing. The engineer meticulously addressed user-reported UI bugs, including missing buttons, poor dropdown visibility, layout issues, and unresponsive elements, leading to a fully polished interface. Subsequently, new features like manual password input for clients, a dedicated Smart TV Activation section, and an App Code field for Android applications were implemented, showcasing adaptability to evolving requirements. The work culminated in a detailed analysis of a provided Telegram bot's code, preparing the panel for deep integration with its functionalities, demonstrating a systematic approach to feature development and problem-solving.

<product_requirements>
The project aimed to develop a TV Panel application from an existing FastAPI/React/MongoDB MVP, porting features from a PHP codebase (). The core functionalities included: IPTV Client Management (CRUD, import/export), License System (keys, expiration, MAC, status), Panel and Application Management, and an Admin Panel (login, settings, password generator).

Initially, advanced features were requested: Telegram bot integration for notifications, advanced reports/analytics, backup/restore functionality, and a mobile API.

The most critical recent requirement was a full database migration from MongoDB to an SQL database (preferably MySQL/PostgreSQL), coupled with data import from provided JSON files and comprehensive editing capabilities within the UI.

Following the migration and initial UI fixes, the user requested further enhancements: manual password input for new clients, a new Smart TV Activation section with auto-generated IDs, manual app name/price input, and currency selection. Additionally, the IPTV Applications section was to be renamed Android Applications and include an app code field for bot integration. The user subsequently provided the bot's code for panel adaptation.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-Stack Development**: React (frontend) and FastAPI (backend).
-   **Database Technologies**: Transitioned from MongoDB (Motor) to SQL (SQLAlchemy for SQLite development, aiming for MySQL/PostgreSQL).
-   **State Management**: Redux Toolkit for React.
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS.
-   **Process Management**: Supervisor for background services.
-   **API Design**: RESTful APIs with  prefix.
-   **Authentication**: JWT for secure API interactions.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is structured as a full-stack project with distinct frontend and backend directories, managed by Supervisor.

**Directory Structure:**


-   : Main FastAPI application file. It integrates SQL-based routers and services like the Telegram bot, handling CORS and application-wide concerns.
-   : The primary React component managing the UI. It has been heavily modified for TV Panel features, SQL data handling, editing capabilities, new sections (Smart TV Activation), and form logic (manual password input, Android App fields).
-   : Python dependencies. Updated to include , , , , , , and  (specifically ).
-   : Manages processes. Updated to run  instead of  and includes .
-   : **New file.** Critical for SQL migration. Defines SQLAlchemy engine, session, and ORM models for all database entities, currently configured for SQLite. Recent changes include adding the  model and the  field to the  model.
-   : **New file.** Contains FastAPI routers for SQL CRUD operations. Updated to include endpoints for  and new fields for  model, also fixed JWT import to use .
-   : **New file.** Script for importing JSON data into the SQL database.
-   : Overall styling. Updated to support new UI elements, editing features, improved dropdown visibility, responsive table design, and interactive settings sections.
-   : **New file.** For Telegram bot integration.
-   : **New file.** For advanced reports.
-   : **New file.** For data backup/restore.
-   : **New file.** For mobile application API.

</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Transition the SQL database connection from SQLite (development) to MySQL/PostgreSQL (production).
-   Verify that all advanced features (Telegram bot, reports, backup/restore, mobile API) are fully functional with the new SQL backend.

<current_work>
The TV Panel application has successfully completed its major database migration from MongoDB to SQL (using SQLite for development). All initial JSON data has been imported, and the frontend has been adapted for editing capabilities across various data types.

Significant UI/UX issues reported by the user were identified and systematically fixed. These included:
1.  **Missing Add new buttons** in Smart TV Apps and Android Apps sections were added by updating  property in .
2.  **Poor visibility of dropdowns** in client forms was resolved by adjusting CSS for background contrast, border colors, and specific styles for  in .
3.  **Table overflow for Payment Methods** was corrected with responsive design CSS (, , touch scrolling).
4.  **Unresponsive System Settings** were made interactive by implementing 6 new clickable sections in  with corresponding CSS for hover effects and pointers.

Following these fixes, new features were implemented:
1.  A **Smart TV Activation** section was added, complete with a new  model in , CRUD endpoints in , and corresponding frontend menu and content rendering in . This allows managing app names, activation prices, currencies, and descriptions.
2.  The **client creation form** in  was modified to require **manual password input**, while retaining an optional Generate button.
3.  IPTV Applications was **renamed to Android Applications** in the frontend, and the  database model and Pydantic models were updated to include new  and  fields.
A critical JWT import error () was identified and fixed in  by changing the import to .

The latest action involved analyzing the provided Telegram bot code () to understand its functionalities and data structures (Android Apps, Smart TV Apps, Payment Methods, Pricing, FAQ, MySQL client table usage) in preparation for integrating the panel seamlessly with the bot without modifying the bot's code itself.
